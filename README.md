# Rutgers Flutter Example

This is a simple app (UI mock for now) that demonstrates what the new Rutgers app could potentially look like.  Feel free to look at the code and suggest changes/edits.  All data is placeholder.

## Getting Started

To setup your environment for Flutter, follow the instructions [here](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install/macos)

I recommend using Android Studio and installing the Flutter SDK through the 'plugins' tab, but you can also download the SDK yourself and build through the Flutter command line tools.
